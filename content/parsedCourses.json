Students  will  synthesize  and  articulate  research  on  any  number  of  subjects  into  formally  presented arguments, both written, multi-media, and oral. There is also a large collaborative component of the course, as students work in teams to present their findings. Similar to a \"First-Year\" seminar experience in college, students will engage in cross-curricular conversations that explore the complexities of academic and real-world topics and issues by analyzing divergent  perspectives  (scientific,  economic,  political,  cultural).  Students  should  be  strong  readers  of  non-fiction primary texts, fluent writers and team players. \n",

They  will  also  explore  one  or  more  alternative  photo  processes  (such  as  multiple  exposures,  cyanotype, solarization and photograms).  \nStudents who successfully complete this course will be able to demonstrate an understanding of current and historical \ndirections in photography through completed works, written reviews of exhibits and class critiques. Students will have the opportunity to take field trips outside of Palo Alto, where they will visit galleries and practice street photography or nature photography. During the second semester, students will develop an independent project and have the option to  create  a  blog  that  features  their  work.  They  will  also  be  introduced  to  online  book  publishing  and  have  the opportunity to create their own photo book. This course may be repeated for credit upon instructor recommendation.  \nHonors students will have additional assignments (written and project-based) beyond those in Advanced Photo, and will select a theme that they pursue independently throughout the year, along with regular meetings for feedback from the  instructor.  Advanced  Photography  Honors  will  prepare  students  interested  in  taking  the  AP  Studio  Art  2-  D Design course. Seniors in Advanced Photo Honors have the opportunity to curate and exhibit their work on campus through a sign-up process. Students may be assigned a museum or gallery visit in Palo Alto or in the Bay Area.  \n",

Students will develop an understanding of major art and design concepts  including  technical,  expressive,  idea  development  and  creative  problem  solving,  critical  thinking,  and  the language of art. Art Spectrum: Digital Emphasis introduces students to Art Spectrum art and design units through the use of Photoshop and Illustrator, two important art software programs, and use of WACOM Digital Drawing Tablets. Students will also engage in digital drawing and painting, including work in light and shadow, perspective, color theory and color application. Short traditional drawing, painting and clay exercises are included to strengthen learning and connections  within  the  various  units.

Outside work may include very occasional sketch or research assignments, and all Art Spectrum students are assigned a Museum Visit. Students will be able to communicate informed critical reflections about their work  and  that  of  others,  develop  an  appreciation  of  the  historical  and  cultural  contributions  of  art  and  design,  and understand connections between art, design and a variety of associated career options. \n",

The curriculum is designed to fit the needs of both four-year-college-bound students and those interested in a two-year career tech education. Conceptual instruction begins with the design cycle, which students experience in all stages, including hands-on skill development from brainstorming to prototyping to manufacturing and testing. Mechanism design and prototyping, programming, electronics, pneumatics, machining and welding, and CAD (computer-aided design) technologies are introduced to all students using industry-standard equipment.  Applications  of  scientific  and  engineering  principles,  group  dynamics,  leadership  and  communication skills are developed in an activity-oriented approach including informal classroom challenges and two or more FIRST Robotics competitions each year. \nStudents who wish to enroll in Engineering Technology must select this course as an Alternate since members will be selected as members of the Gunn Robotics Team (GRT). Team members will be selected based on team needs of skills. An application process will be used to award spaces within GRT, and detailed information regarding this process will be published in January. Students who have completed Introduction to Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering and Robotics, an Automotive Technology course, or a Stage Technology course will be given special consideration during the selection process.  \n",
